### SNES Audio Mods
---

This is a collection of earlier projects. These projects are not under development anymore. Documentation is rather simple or simply not present

Please don't write me for any support. Please reach out to community forums and use the knowledge and experiences there.

If you want to change something on the digital audio mod, I suggest you to replace the TI-SPDIF audio encoder by CirrusLogic-SPDIF audio encoder of same size (but different pinout).

Best Regards, Peter
