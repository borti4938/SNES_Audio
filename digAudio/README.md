### IMPORTANT NOTE:

There is a bug on all PCBs manifacture before Jan 5th., 2023!
Pin 14 on the DIT4096 IC is not properly connected.
Instead of tied to GND the pin was left floating.

If you have one effected board, you can easily fix that.
Simply connect pin 14 of the DIT4096 on your PCB to GND.
This pin is a corner pin and you can use any GND pad.
This should be an easy fix.

Sorry for any inconvenience caused!
